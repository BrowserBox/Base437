- point is aesthetics, it looks the way it's supposed to look
- point is also it's valid unicode and can be put anywhere (ie, not ascii control charas that will garble output and terminals)
- point is you can actually see the content as if you were really examining the file. Easily grep for strings, or visually scan for them, unlike in base64. 
- surfaces binary into a consistent, reliable visual language, aiding quick analysis and inspection
